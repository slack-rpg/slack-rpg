## Features
- Each Channel the bot is invited to will become a new location in the game.
- Each Location can have non-playable characters (NPC) and/or monsters
- Players can join game and build a character
- Players can interact with Locations, NPCs and monsters
- Players can gain experience interacting with certain things and accomplishing quests
- Players can search for and find equip-able items

## Locations
When your GM is invited to a new channel, it will generate a new Location and link it to the channel. Locations will have any number of Points of Interest. When a location is first generated, it will have a NPC ruler of a certain class/level.  When a player reaches that level, they can challenge the NPC to a battle.  If they win they become the new ruler of the location. Other players can challenge  that player to become the new ruler.

### Location Types
Location can be of various types:
- **Tavern**: Usually contains NPCs and a quest board
- **Adventure**: An area of danger and intrigue
- **Shop**: An area to buy and sell items

## Non-Player characters
Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are characters controlled by the Dungeon Master. They could give out quests, rule locations, or just be regular hang about's. NPCs are usually friendly toward players unless provoked.

## Monsters
Monsters are NPCs that are hostile toward players. They can be defeated for experience during battles.

## Battles
